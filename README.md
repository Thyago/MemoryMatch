Hello!<br>
This is just a simple Memory Match game inspired in the EDX course:
Asynchronous Programming with Javascript (Microsoft: DEV234x)<br>
I made it a bit flexible to allow you to be able to set your own cards (and as many as you want).

It's based in a few hours of work and still needs some code refactoring.

Have fun!
